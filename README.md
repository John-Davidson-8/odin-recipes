# odin-recipes

This is the first Odin project and it is to cement the html and git/github skills I have learned. I am attempting to create and navigate all files from the shell. I hope to commit early and often describing succinctly what I have created or changed in the code. I also have to learn that the commits are to be no more than 72 characters long and the subject line no more than 50 characters long.
